# Android-song

Android-song is a static audio player App for raw resources. It's all based on a Seekbar element and a `mediaPlayer` object for the audio file interaction.

Additionally, the App implements a Thread object for rendering the starting and remaining `minute:second` time calculation based on the audio file duration. This provides a significantly better experience in terms of performance and functionality.

The whole implementation is on the `onCreate` activity method.
